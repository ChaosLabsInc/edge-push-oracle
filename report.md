# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

## L-2: `ecrecover` is susceptible to signature malleability

The `ecrecover` function is susceptible to signature malleability. This means that the same message can be signed in multiple ways, allowing an attacker to change the message signature without invalidating it. This can lead to unexpected behavior in smart contracts, such as the loss of funds or the ability to bypass access control. Consider using OpenZeppelin's ECDSA library instead of the built-in function.

	```solidity
	        return ecrecover(_messageHash, v, r, s); // Recover and return signer address
	```

</details>



## L-3: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/EdgePushOracle.sol [Line: 2](src/EdgePushOracle.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.25;
	```

</details>



## L-4: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/EdgePushOracle.sol [Line: 170](src/EdgePushOracle.sol#L170)

	```solidity
	    function getRoundData(uint80 round)
	```

</details>



## L-5: Define and use `constant` variables instead of using literals

If the same constant literal value is used multiple times, create a constant state variable and reference it throughout the contract.

<details><summary>3 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/EdgePushOracle.sol [Line: 277](src/EdgePushOracle.sol#L277)

	```solidity
	        if (v < 27) {
	```

- Found in src/EdgePushOracle.sol [Line: 278](src/EdgePushOracle.sol#L278)

	```solidity
	            v += 27; // Adjust v
	```

- Found in src/EdgePushOracle.sol [Line: 282](src/EdgePushOracle.sol#L282)

	```solidity
	        require(v == 27 || v == 28, "Invalid signature v value"); // Check v value
	```

</details>



## L-6: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

	```solidity
	    event NewPriceUpdate(
	```

</details>



## L-7: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.25;
	```

</details>



## L-8: Loop contains `require`/`revert` statements

Avoid `require` / `revert` statements in a loop because a single bad item can cause the whole transaction to fail. It's better to forgive on fail and return failed elements post processing of the loop

- Found in src/EdgePushOracle.sol [Line: 108](src/EdgePushOracle.sol#L108)

	```solidity
	        for (uint256 i = 0; i < numSignatures; i++) {
	```

</details>



## L-9: Costly operations inside loops.

Invoking `SSTORE`operations in loops may lead to Out-of-gas errors. Use a local variable to hold the loop computation result.

	```solidity
	        for (uint256 i = 0; i < oracles.length; i++) {
	```

</details>



## L-10: State variable changes but no event is emitted.

State variable changes in this function but no event is emitted.
